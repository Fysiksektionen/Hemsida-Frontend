# Broken things
These things worked before, but have not yet been implemented using the new mock api.

* Setting parent page in the page editor (see [PageMetaForm.tsx](src/components/admin/pages/PageMetaForm.tsx)).
* References to static mock images.
* PageEditor has 404 as a loading screen.
* And presumably a few other things.
